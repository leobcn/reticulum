# Contribute

Please!

Pull requests, bug reports, feature requests, and code and
documentation feedback are all greatly appreciated.

This is my first serious project in the Go programming language so I'd
*really* love constructive criticism on how I can improve the code.

All I ask is that if you submit code via a pull-request or diff,
please run `go fmt` on it first. 

If you are running Reticulum, let me know and I'll try to throw some
links your way.
